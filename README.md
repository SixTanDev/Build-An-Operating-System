# Awesome Async Adventures - build-an-Operating-System 🚀

Welcome to the Awesome Async Adventures repository! 🎉 

Are you ready to dive into the world of multitasking, coroutines, and async magic? This repository is your gateway to understanding how multitasking can be achieved using a single thread and the power of coroutines. 🧙‍♂️

## What's Inside? 📦

Inside this repository, you'll find an exhilarating journey through the heart of multitasking and asynchronous programming. We've got a bunch of cool classes and examples to help you grasp these concepts:

### Scheduler 🔄

The `Scheduler` class is your guide to orchestrating tasks like a maestro! It lets you create, schedule, and execute tasks based on coroutines. Imagine managing multiple tasks with a single thread! 😮

```
# Create an instance of the Scheduler
sched = Scheduler()

# Create tasks using coroutines
sched.create_task(task=coroutine_1())
sched.create_task(task=coroutine_2())

# Let the event loop begin!
sched.run_event_loop()
```

### System Calls 📞
Ever wanted to control the CPU's attention like a magician's sleight of hand? Introducing the System Calls – the secret spells that allow tasks to communicate and share CPU time. We've got GetTid, NewTask, KillTask, and even a WaitTask to keep things thrilling! 🎩✨

```
# Launch a new task with GetTid and NewTask
child = yield NewTask(coroutine())

# Simulate task interactions and terminate tasks with KillTask
for i in range(5):
    yield
yield KillTask(child)
```

### Task Class 🏃‍♂️
Meet the Task class – your dynamic duo partner for coroutines! It wraps your coroutines, letting you manage and control their execution. 🦸‍♀️

```
# Create a task with a coroutine
task_1 = Task(coroutine=coroutine())
task_1.run()
```

How Does it Relate to the GIL? 🐍
This adventure is closely tied to the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) in CPython. By mastering coroutines, system calls, and scheduling, you'll unlock the secrets of maximizing CPU utilization and crafting responsive applications.

Get ready to unleash your Python multitasking prowess and conquer the async world! 🎮🌐
